Hi! This project was built for INFO 343 B Autumn Quarter 2017 for our final project. This app was built by Godwin, Avani, Tae, and Dustin.

This app allows people to connect with their Facebooks friends and explore their scheduled. It also shows you what friends are taking the classes that you have signed up for. 

You can view the live version of the applicaiton here: godwinvincent.github.io/friend_schedule/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
